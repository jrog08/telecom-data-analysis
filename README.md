Telecom Data - Churn Analysis
In this analysis I will be using R as the main tool to help analyze the customer data for a telecommunications company who is concerned about their customer attrition. R is a great open-source statistical tool that has an expansive library that is always growing.
R runs on almost all systems and is very stable and reliable. R makes it easy to extract and load data. There are dozens of file formats from which one can choose.1 In this analysis I will be using a .csv file, from which I will read in and extract the data using the read.csv function. This is an easy way to extract and load data into R, and is one of the many benefits of this software.2
The Goal
The goal of this analysis is to mitigate customer loss and reverse it by identifying indicators of customer churn and reporting back to the leadership team so they can make an informed business decision on what changes need to be made. This will be done by using a software called R that is designed to “provide a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.”
